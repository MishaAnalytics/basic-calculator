A beginner-friendly Python calculator — the start of my data science journey)
# 🧮 Basic Calculator

This project is one of my first steps into programming.  
It’s a simple calculator built in **Python** that can perform basic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — using user input.  
Even though it looks simple, it helped me understand how logic and structure come together in code.

### 🎯 What I Learned
- Handling user input and working with strings in Python  
- Using `if` / `elif` statements to control logic  
- Translating an idea into working code from scratch  
- The importance of testing and improving small details

### 🌱 Personal Growth Note
This was my first personal project in my data science journey.  
I wanted to see how real code works and how computers “think.”  
It may be basic, but for me it represents the start of something bigger — learning to build, solve, and explore with data.  
Every small project like this brings me closer to my goal of studying **Econometrics and Data Science**.
